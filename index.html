      <h1>What is Mental Health to me?</h1>
      <p>
         Mental health to me is a state of healthy self consciousness and self image. This particularly comes to play during the times
         when I am experiencing challenges in my life. If I manage to go through those challenges without distorting the view of 
         myself, then I am a mentally health individual at that point if otherwise, then I am not. I have struggled with my mental
         health for the longest time. But I have also learned how to pull myself out of the deep sea of sadness, by allowing myself to 
         feel the pain and still remember that it's part of human nature to go through obstacles. Having said this, I am not excusing 
         any other diagnoses people might have, but I am sharing my experience.</p>
